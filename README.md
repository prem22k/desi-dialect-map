## ‚ú® About the Project

The Desi Dialect Map is a full-stack Streamlit application that functions as a powerful "Corpus Collection Engine." It allows users to upload images of objects, scenes, or cultural items and tag them with the words used in their local dialects. This crowdsourced data is then visualized on an interactive map of India, creating a living, breathing atlas of our country's vernacular languages.

The mission is to ethically gather a rich, geotagged dataset of text and images to power the next generation of inclusive AI.

## üöÄ Key Features

*   **Interactive Folium Map:** A high-performance map with custom emoji markers, interactive popups (displaying images and dialect words), and a heatmap layer to visualize submission density.
*   **User-Generated Content:** A robust file uploader allows users to contribute their own images, which are stored in a local SQLite database.
*   **Advanced Data Exploration:** The platform features a powerful search bar and a state-based dropdown to filter submissions on both the map and the gallery.
*   **Performance-Optimized:** The application is built for speed, with smart caching for all database queries and geocoding lookups to ensure a snappy user experience.
*   **Dynamic UI:** The app features a "Submission of the Day" section to keep the content fresh and engaging, along with a dashboard of project statistics.
*   **Data Export:** All collected data can be easily exported to a CSV file for further analysis.
