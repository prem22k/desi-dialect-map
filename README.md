# Desi Dialect Map üó∫Ô∏èüìç

### A Summer of AI 2025 Project by Team "ahjin Guild"

---

Welcome to the official repository for the **Desi Dialect Map**! This project is a fun, interactive Streamlit application designed to create a crowdsourced, living map of India's incredible linguistic diversity.

## üéØ Our Mission

Our core goal is to build an engaging "Corpus Collection Engine" disguised as a user-friendly app. By allowing users to pin their local words for common objects onto a map of India, we are ethically gathering a rich, geotagged dataset of vernacular language. This corpus of text and audio data will be invaluable for training the next generation of AI to understand and communicate in authentic Indian languages, directly contributing to the mission of **viswam.ai**.

## ‚ú® Key Features (MVP)

* **Interactive Map:** Visualize linguistic diversity across India in real-time.
* **Easy Contribution:** Submit words in your local dialect with just a few clicks.
* **Audio Recording:** Optionally record the pronunciation of your word to enrich the dataset.
* **Low-Bandwidth Friendly:** Designed to be fast and accessible for everyone.

## üöÄ Project Roadmap

* **Phase 0 (Current):** Project Planning & Submission
* **Week 1:** Rapid Development of the Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
* **Week 2:** Beta Testing & Iteration Cycle
* **Weeks 3-4:** Full-scale User Acquisition & Corpus Growth Campaign

For a comprehensive breakdown of our project plan, technical architecture, and team roles, please see our detailed **[REPORT.md](REPORT.md)**.
