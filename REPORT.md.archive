## 1.2. Application Overview

Our project, the "Desi Dialect Map," is an interactive, gamified Streamlit application designed to crowdsource a rich, geotagged atlas of India's linguistic diversity. The app presents users with an image of a common object or concept and asks them to submit the word for it in their local dialect, optionally recording a short audio clip of its pronunciation. These submissions populate a live map of India, creating a vibrant, user-generated visualization of our country's vernacular languages. While providing a fun and engaging platform for users to celebrate their local identity, the app functions as a powerful Corpus Collection Engine, ethically gathering invaluable text, audio, and location data to train next-generation AI.

## 1.3. AI Integration Details

The primary AI value is in the unique **corpus** we are creating. Our data-focused approach leverages the specific skills of our team:
1.  **Corpus Management & Architecture:** **Lakshya**, as our AI/ML lead, will architect the data pipeline and database schema (using SQL) to ensure the collected data is clean, structured, and ready for analysis.
2.  **Data Analysis & Insights:** **Eesha**, as our team's Data Scientist, will play a key role in the later stages by analyzing the collected corpus using Python libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib to uncover linguistic patterns and insights, which can guide future feature development.
3.  **Future AI Roadmap:** The dataset is a springboard for advanced AI. Our vision includes training localized speech-to-text models and creating data visualizations with Tableau/Power BI to showcase the project's impact, making it a sustainable engine for viswam.ai.

## 1.4. Technical Architecture & Development

* **Framework:** Streamlit
* **Deployment:** Hugging Face Spaces
* **Language:** Python
* **Development:** With two strong full-stack developers, **Prem** and **Lakshya**, and a core developer, **Bhavani**, our team has a robust foundation to rapidly prototype and build the application.
* **Frontend & Design:** **Eesha's** data-centric approach and **Prem's** Figma skills will guide the creation of an intuitive and engaging UI that makes data contribution effortless for the user.
* **Version Control:** The entire team will operate under a strict Git workflow, managed by **Prem**, to ensure smooth collaboration.

## 1.6. Project Lifecycle & Roadmap

This section details our plan and execution across the 4-week timeline.

### A. Week 1: Rapid Development Sprint

* **Day 1-2:** **Eesha** to lead and finalize the UI/UX design in Figma. **Prem** to set up the initial Streamlit app structure.
* **Day 3-4:** **Prem**, **Lakshya**, and **Bhavani** will spearhead the core application development, building out the UI, backend logic, and data submission flow.
* **Day 5-6:** Integration of the database (SQL) and end-to-end testing of the user flow. Team-wide bug bash.
* **Day 7:** Deploy the functional MVP to Hugging Face Spaces. **Architha** to begin preparing initial promotional content based on the live app.

### B. Week 2: Beta Testing & Iteration Cycle

Our testing phase in Week 2 is designed to be agile and user-focused, ensuring our application is robust and accessible before the main growth campaign.

* **Methodology:** We will recruit a beta testing group of 15-20 fellow students from diverse departments at SNIST. Each tester will be given a simple set of tasks (e.g., "Submit the word for 'rain' in your dialect," "Try the app on your mobile data connection"). Feedback will be collected via a streamlined Google Form.
* **Low-Bandwidth Focus:** A key part of our testing is to confirm the app's performance on slow or unstable internet connections, a core requirement of the project.
* **Iteration Cycle:** All feedback and bugs will be logged as issues in our GitLab repository. We will prioritize critical bugs for immediate fixes during Week 2, ensuring a stable and user-friendly app for the growth phase.

### C. Weeks 3-4: User Acquisition & Corpus Growth Campaign

This phase is our top priority. It will be led by our Growth & Marketing Lead, **Architha Reddy**, a 3rd-year CSE-AIML student who possesses proven experience in community building and marketing from her leadership roles at SNIST.

* **Target Audience:** Primarily college students (ages 18-24) at SNIST and other Hyderabad colleges, expanding to other regions. We will also target local community groups online.
* **Channels:** University WhatsApp/Telegram groups, SNIST-wide announcements, collaborations with other college tech/cultural fests, and posts on regional subreddits and Instagram pages.
* **Growth Strategy & Messaging:**
    * **Campaign Theme:** "Put Your Dialect on the Map!"
    * **Execution:** **Architha** will spearhead the creation of shareable content (posters, videos). **Eesha** and **Prem**, with their content and design experience, will support this effort. We will run a "Dialect of the Week" feature on social media, highlighting interesting submissions to drive engagement. A leaderboard showing which college has contributed the most words will gamify the experience and foster friendly competition, driving the viral growth essential for massive corpus collection.

### D. Post-Internship Vision & Sustainability Plan

Our vision for the "Desi Dialect Map" extends beyond this internship. We see it as a living project with long-term value for viswam.ai and the open-source community.

* **Major Future Features:** We plan to introduce a gamified user leaderboard to boost engagement, expand the app to include regional phrases and idioms, and develop a "Linguistic Atlas" view for deeper data exploration.
* **Community Building:** We aim to build a community of "Language Guardians" on platforms like Discord or Telegram, who can help validate submissions and promote the app in their local regions.
* **Sustainability:** The project's ultimate success is in the high-quality corpus it provides to **viswam.ai**. We are committed to open-sourcing all our code and methodologies, allowing other researchers and developers to build upon our work and contribute to the mission of preserving India's linguistic heritage.
