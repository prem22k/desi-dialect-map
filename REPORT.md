## 1.2. Application Overview

Our project, the "Desi Dialect Map," is an interactive, gamified Streamlit application designed to crowdsource a rich, geotagged atlas of India's linguistic diversity. The app presents users with an image of a common object or concept and asks them to submit the word for it in their local dialect, optionally recording a short audio clip of its pronunciation. These submissions populate a live map of India, creating a vibrant, user-generated visualization of our country's vernacular languages. While providing a fun and engaging platform for users to celebrate their local identity, the app functions as a powerful Corpus Collection Engine, ethically gathering invaluable text, audio, and location data to train next-generation AI.

## 1.3. AI Integration Details

The primary AI value is in the unique **corpus** we are creating. The project will be led by our AI/ML Lead, Lakshya, leveraging his skills in Python and Machine Learning.
1.  **Corpus Management:** Lakshya's experience with Python and SQL will be crucial for designing a clean, structured database schema to store the incoming text, audio, and location data efficiently.
2.  **Future AI Roadmap:** The collected dataset is the perfect foundation for advanced AI models. Our vision includes training a localized speech-to-text model, a vernacular voice assistant, or an AI that can predict a user's region based on their word choice. This plan makes our project a sustainable data engine for future AI research at viswam.ai.

## 1.4. Technical Architecture & Development

* **Framework:** Streamlit

## 1.6. Project Lifecycle & Roadmap

### A. Week 1: Rapid Development Sprint Plan

* **Day 1-2:** **Eesha** to lead and finalize the UI/UX design in Figma. **Prem** to set up the initial Streamlit app structure.
* **Day 3-4:** **Prem** and **Lakshya**, as our full-stack developers, will spearhead the core application development, building out both the UI components and the backend logic for data submission.
* **Day 5-6:** Integration of the database (Firebase/SQL) and end-to-end testing of the user flow. Team-wide bug bash.
* **Day 7:** Deploy the functional MVP to Hugging Face Spaces. **Architha** to begin preparing initial promotional content based on the live app.

### C. Weeks 3-4: User Acquisition & Corpus Growth Campaign

This phase is our top priority and will be led by our Growth & Marketing Lead, **Architha Reddy**, leveraging her extensive experience in event management, social media, and content strategy from her leadership roles at SDC SNIST and E-SPORTSCLUB.

* **Target Audience:** Primarily college students (ages 18-24) across Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, expanding to other regions. We will also target local community groups.
* **Channels:** University WhatsApp/Telegram groups, SNIST-wide announcements, collaborations with other college tech/cultural fests, and posts on regional subreddits and Instagram pages.
* **Growth Strategy & Messaging:**
    * **Campaign Theme:** "Put Your Dialect on the Map!"
    * **Execution:** Architha will spearhead the creation of shareable content, including posters and short videos. Eesha and Prem will assist with content writing. We will run a "Dialect of the Week" feature on social media, highlighting the most interesting submissions to drive engagement. We will gamify the experience by creating a leaderboard showing which college has contributed the most words, fostering a friendly competitive spirit. This strategy is designed for viral, organic growth, which is essential for massive corpus collection.
