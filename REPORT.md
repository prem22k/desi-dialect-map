## 1.2. Application Overview

Our project, the "Desi Dialect Map," is an interactive, gamified Streamlit application designed to crowdsource a rich, geotagged atlas of India's linguistic diversity. The app presents users with an image of a common object or concept and asks them to submit the word for it in their local dialect, optionally recording a short audio clip of its pronunciation. These submissions populate a live map of India, creating a vibrant, user-generated visualization of our country's vernacular languages. While providing a fun and engaging platform for users to celebrate their local identity, the app functions as a powerful Corpus Collection Engine, ethically gathering invaluable text, audio, and location data to train next-generation AI.

## 1.3. AI Integration Details

The primary AI value is in the unique **corpus** we are creating. Our data-focused approach leverages the specific skills of our team:

1. **Corpus Management & Architecture:** **Lakshya**, as our AI/ML lead, will architect the data pipeline and database schema (using SQL) to ensure the collected data is clean, structured, and ready for analysis.
2. **Data Analysis & Insights:** **Eesha**, as our team's Data Scientist, will play a key role in the later stages by analyzing the collected corpus using Python libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib to uncover linguistic patterns and insights, which can guide future feature development.
3. **Future AI Roadmap:** The dataset is a springboard for advanced AI. Our vision includes training localized speech-to-text models and creating data visualizations with Tableau/Power BI to showcase the project's impact, making it a sustainable engine for viswam.ai.
