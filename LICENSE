Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license
for software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to
ensure cooperation with the community in the case of network server
software.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,
our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a programâ€”to make sure it remains free
software for all its users. When we speak of free software, we are
referring to freedom, not price.

Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if
you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,
that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free
programs, and that you know you can do these things. Developers that use
our General Public Licenses protect your rights with two steps: (1)
assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License which
gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that
improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they receive
widespread use, become available for other developers to incorporate.

Many developers of free software are heartened and encouraged by the
resulting cooperation. However, in the case of software used on network
servers, this result may fail to come about. The GNU General Public
License permits making a modified version and letting the public access
it on a server without ever releasing its source code to the public.

The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to ensure
that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available to the
community. It requires the operator of a network server to provide the
source code of the modified version running there to the users of that
server. Therefore, public use of a modified version, on a publicly
accessible server, gives the public access to the source code of the
modified version.

                            TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public
  License.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
  License. "You" refers to any licensee receiving a copy of the Program.

1. Source Code.

  The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
  making modifications to it. It includes all scripts, interface definition
  files, and build or deployment scripts used to control compilation and
  installation of the executable.

2. Basic Permissions.

  You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
  code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you:
    - Include this License and copyright notice.
    - Keep intact all notices stating that this License applies.

3. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a modified version of the Program under the terms of
  this License provided that you:
    - Clearly indicate changes you made and the date of those changes.
    - License the entire work under this License.
    - Display appropriate legal notices if the work has interactive
      user interfaces.

4. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey the work in object code or executable form under the
  terms of this License provided that you:
    - Accompany it with the complete corresponding source code.
    - Offer access to the source code via a network server if the
      executable is run over a network.

5. Additional Terms.

  You may add additional permissions, provided they do not contradict
  the terms of this License. Additional permissions may be removed by
  downstream recipients.

6. Termination.

  Your rights under this License terminate if you violate any terms.
  However, recipients who receive the Program from you under this License
  are not affected.

7. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run
  a copy of the Program. However, nothing else grants you permission to
  modify or distribute the Program.

8. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  The Program is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind. The
  authors are not responsible for any damages arising from its use.

9. Limitation of Liability.

  In no event will the authors be liable for any claim, damages, or other
  liability, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out
  of, or in connection with the Program or its use.
